I've never written code in C before. :)
The code above is my attempt at making it possible to bind multiple commands to a single key. (single, double, long press, etc.)
Uses sudo privileges because it monitors the keyboard. IDK how else to do it, maybe this is some cybersecurity cardinal sin ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ oh well.
